# Python Calculator

A simple calculator application built with Python and the Tkinter library. This project demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for interaction. The calculator supports operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, square, and more.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`
- Advanced operations: `x²` (square), `²√x` (square root), `1/x` (reciprocal)
- Clear button (`C`) to reset the display
- Backspace (`«`) to remove the last entered character
- Toggle negative/positive value (`±`)
- Result display after pressing the `=` button
